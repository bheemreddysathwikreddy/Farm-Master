    <h2>Robotic & Precision Farming</h2>
    <p class="small-muted">Technology is transforming Indian agriculture: affordable drones, sensors and automation help farmers increase yields, reduce inputs and manage risk. Below are key components, benefits and practical steps to adopt robotic farming.</p>

    <section class="content-section article">
      <div>
        <h3>Drones & Aerial Platforms</h3>
        <p>Drones collect high-resolution RGB and multispectral imagery for crop scouting, plant-health indices (NDVI/EVI), and canopy mapping. They are also used for targeted foliar spraying and seeding in difficult terrain.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use-cases:</strong> field scouting, variable-rate spraying, pest hot-spot detection, creating prescription maps.</li>
          <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> faster coverage, earlier detection of stress, reduced chemical use when spraying is targeted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Autonomous Tractors & Ground Robots</h3>
        <p>Autonomous tractors and small robots perform seeding, mechanical weeding, inter-row cultivation and even harvesting for some crops. They use RTK-GPS, LiDAR and computer vision for precise navigation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use-cases:</strong> precision seeding, automated weeding, spot-harvesting, payload transport.</li>
          <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> labor savings, consistent field operations, ability to work longer hours and in challenging conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sensors, IoT & Edge Devices</h3>
        <p>Networked soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and crop sensors provide continuous local telemetry. Edge devices can run simple analytics and trigger irrigation or alerts without constant internet connectivity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use-cases:</strong> automated irrigation scheduling, frost/freeze alerts, disease risk estimation.</li>
          <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> better input timing, reduced water and fertilizer waste, improved resilience to weather variability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Analytics, Models & Farm OS</h3>
        <p>Collected data is processed into actionable recommendations: variable-rate maps, disease risk forecasts and yield estimates. Cloud platforms and simple farm-management dashboards help smallholders and cooperatives collaborate on decisions.</p>

        <h3>Practical Adoption Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Start small: pilot a drone or sensor pack on one field to measure benefits.</li>
          <li>Use leased equipment or service providers if upfront cost is high.</li>
          <li>Train local operators on safety, maintenance and data interpretation.</li>
          <li>Integrate slowly: combine sensor feedback with existing practices rather than replacing them immediately.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Challenges & Considerations</h3>
        <p>Barriers include cost, connectivity, repair and spare parts, regulatory approvals for spraying drones, and data literacy. Public programs and startups increasingly offer financing, leasing and training to bridge these gaps.</p>

        <h3>Examples & Use-Cases in India</h3>
        <p>Use-cases in India span precision paddy management with drone-based health mapping, autonomous vegetable transplanters, and sensor-led micro-irrigation for orchards. Cooperative models and government-supported pilots accelerate adoption.</p>
